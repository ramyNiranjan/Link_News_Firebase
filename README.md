# Link news platform
Link News is a platform where all users can share their daily news with others by linking to a news feed on another news site while users can participate in others' news feeds by liking or commenting on the feed. I created this platform so that the hot topic on the internet can be easily shared. At the moment it looks very primitive but in the near future I will add more features and improve UX more.
